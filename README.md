# BabelWeb
**A polyglot browser for a liberated Web.** Why should JavaScript be the only language allowed in the browser? BabelWeb offers a multi-runtime architecture where Python, C#, Rust, and many others can coexist, interact with the DOM, and offer true freedom to developers.

## Goals

- Allow each website to choose its runtime language
- Integrate secure runtimes (Python, C#, Rust, etc.) into the browser
- Expose the DOM via typed bindings for each language
- Maintain compatibility with existing sites
- Create a modular, extensible, and secure architecture
